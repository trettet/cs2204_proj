        An advantage that the LRU Page Replacement Algorithm has is that it can never result in more than N-times more page faults than OPT(Optimal) algorithm, where N is proportional to the number of pages in the managed pool.

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Its disadvantage is that LRU is expensive to implement. For example: if it's implemented using a linked list containing all the pages in memory, the items will have to be moved about every memory reference thus making it time consuming. Its main disadvantage is that the performance degenerates under many quite common reference patterns or a looped pattern for page referencing is used.
