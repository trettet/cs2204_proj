        Preemptive Priority Scheduling is very simple to implement and has a reasonable support for priority. Furthermore, it is suitable for applications that vary in time and resource requirements.

        On the other hand, Preemptive Priority has it's flaws. It can cause indefinite blocking or what we commonly call starvation. There would be cases wherein processes with low priority do not get serviced for a very long period of time. If the system unexpectedly crashes, then all the unfinished low priority processes get lost.
